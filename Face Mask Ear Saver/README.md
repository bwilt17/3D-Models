## Project Overview:
As you're certainly aware, the Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in a new era of necessary accessories: face masks. In order to prevent the spread and protect others, face masks are required in all public places. The most effective of these masks are N-95 or surgical masks, though homemade, double-layered cotton masks have also been recommended. As surgical masks have become more readily available, and with more contagious Covid-19 variants now making the rounds across the country, the newest recommendation is to wear a surgical mask with a cotton mask over top for added protection.

Now, the problem is, surgical masks use loops over the ears to hold them in place. I have extremely sensitive ears, and the skin behind them can split open or become irritated even from wearing headphones at my desk. As you might expect, this makes wearing surgical masks for even short times a pain. I saw some "mask hook" and "ear saver" products floating around the internet and figured, since I still have access to SolidWorks through my University and access to a 3D printer, I could just make my own!

## Goals:
The main goals were to make it small, easy to use, and attractive. I also wanted the design to be easy to print on any 3D printer.

## Modeling and Printing:

This part was modeled in SolidWorks 2020. STL and SLDPRT files can be found under [files](https://github.com/bwilt17/Face-Mask-Ear-Saver/tree/main/files). General print settings will vary per printer, so you will need to tune them to your specific printer prior to printing.

The printing specifications for my 3D printer were as follows:

**Printer**: Kingroon KP3

**Filament**: TechBears White PLA

**Nozzle Temp.**: 190 C

**Bed Temp.**: 60 C

**Print Speed**: 30 mm/s

## Results:
The "ear saver" works fantastic for my purposes, and achieves all the goals I had set for it. It's small enough to slip into my pocket or bag so that I always have it on hand, and it allows the loops of the surgical masks to wrap around the back of my neck, under my ears, as opposed to resting on my sensitive ears. I have not had any major issues with comfort either.

One issue I've found in using this tool is that, because the ear loops of the mask are lower than intended, the mask is a bit baggy around my chin. I use this in conjunction with a well-fitting fabric mask on top, so this isn't a problem, but I would not recommend using it this way without having a secondary, well-fitting mask on top of it. Knotting the ear loops at the edge of the mask may also help to prevent this issue.
