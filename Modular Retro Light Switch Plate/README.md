# Retro Modular Switch Plate
Switch plate designed in SolidWorks 2020. Its main design goals were aesthetics and modular functionality via exchangable hooks that snap into the bottom of the plate.

# Modeling and Printing:

Several iterations of this plate were prototyped, the final being the design included in this repository. This will be updated as-needed should there be any changes when modeling the attachments. If 3D printing using a regular FDM printer, print the switch plate with the front facing down on the bed for best results. 

This switch plate is designed for use with rocker-style light switches, but the SLDPRT file contains modifications for regular toggle switches. STL and SLDPRT can be found under [files](https://github.com/bwilt17/3D-Models/tree/main/Modular%20Retro%20Light%20Switch%20Plate/files).

The printing specifications for my 3D printer were as follows:

**Printer:** Kingroon KP3

**Filament:** Hatchbox Black PLA

**Nozzle Temp.:** 190 C

**Bed Temp.:** 60 C

**Print Speed:** 30 mm/s
